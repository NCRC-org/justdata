      "detailed_summary": "Analysis of STOCK Act filings reveals unprecedented trading volumes in financial sector securities among congressional members. **[[official:michael_mccaul|Rep. Michael T.

Ro Khanna (D-California)]]** ranked third with $277.80 million total volume in banking and investment securities.\n\nThe concentration of trading activity among these top three officials represents over $964 million in financial sector transactions, with particular emphasis on emerging fintech and traditional banking investments. This level of activity raises questions about potential conflicts of interest given Congress's regulatory oversight of these same industries.\n\n• McCaul: $368.04M total volume (52% sells, 48% buys)\n• Gottheimer: $319.15M total volume (51% sells, 49% buys)\n• Khanna: $277.80M total volume (49% sells, 51% buys)",

The absence of corresponding PAC activity suggests either a reporting lag, regulatory restrictions, or strategic timing considerations.\n\nThe tracked firms showing zero PAC contributions include major technology and financial companies like Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, and Amazon, despite these being among the most actively traded securities by congressional members.
