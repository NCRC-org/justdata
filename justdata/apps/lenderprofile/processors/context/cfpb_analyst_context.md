# CFPB Complaints Analyst Context for LenderProfile

## Purpose
Analyze CFPB Consumer Complaint Database data to understand consumer issues and stress points with the institution.

## About the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database

### Overview
- Database launched in 2011
- Consumers file complaints via phone or website
- Companies notified and given 15 days to respond before complaint goes public
- Consumers can provide written narratives (optional, with consent for publication)
- Identifying information redacted before publication

### Value of Complaint Data
- **"Barometer of financial pressure"** being experienced by consumers
- Provides insight into types of problems people face with servicers and lenders
- Can help identify "bad actors" and problematic products
- Useful for enforcement of existing consumer protection laws
- Shows how institutions respond to consumer stress during crises

### Complaint Categories
Main product types tracked:
- **Credit reporting/consumer reports** (largest category, 55-65% of complaints)
- **Debt collection**
- **Mortgages**
- **Credit cards**
- **Checking/savings accounts**
- **Student loans**
- **Vehicle loans**
- **Money transfers**
- **Payday loans**

## Interpreting Complaint Volume

### What Complaint Spikes Can Indicate
- Economic stress on consumers (unemployment, income loss)
- Confusion about new programs or policies
- Customer service failures (overwhelmed call centers)
- Errors in credit reporting or account handling
- Issues with forbearance or hardship programs
- Problems negotiating repayment options

### COVID-19 Example
- Pre-pandemic: ~22,000 complaints/month (stable 2017-Feb 2020)
- March 2020: 29,494 complaints
- April 2020: 35,062 complaints (all-time high at that point)
- Credit reporting complaints increased from 55% to 64% of total
- Spike correlated with unemployment claims and CARES Act passage

### Common Consumer Issues (from narratives)
- Problems negotiating alternative repayment options
- Unable to reach customer service
- Errors in credit reporting affecting payment arrangements
- Debt collection during hardship periods
- Forbearance confusion
- Difficulty accessing benefits

## What to Analyze

### Key Metrics
1. **Total complaint volume** (absolute number)
2. **Trend direction** (increasing, decreasing, stable)
3. **Year-over-year change**
4. **Top complaint categories** for this institution

### Context Considerations
- Large institutions naturally have more complaints due to more customers
- Trend direction matters more than absolute numbers
- Spikes may correlate with economic events, policy changes, or service issues
- Declining complaints can indicate improved service or resolution

### What NOT to Do
- Don't make direct comparisons to other lenders without normalizing for size
- Don't interpret high volume alone as evidence of wrongdoing
- Present the data descriptively - let user interpret significance

## Output Format
- Note total complaints and trend
- List top complaint categories if available
- Note any significant year-over-year changes
- Keep analysis descriptive, not judgmental
- Don't score or rate the institution based on complaints alone

## NCRC Perspective
The CFPB Complaint Database is a "crucial" resource despite being derided as "Yelp for banks" by some. It provides:
- Clear indication of consumer problems
- Window into hardships consumers endure
- Data for enforcement and accountability
- Insight into how institutions serve (or fail) consumers during crises
