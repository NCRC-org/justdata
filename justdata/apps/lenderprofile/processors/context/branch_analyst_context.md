# Branch Analyst Context for LenderProfile

## Purpose
Analyze FDIC branch network data to assess branch closures and their impact on community access to banking services.

## The Branch Closure Crisis - Key Context

### The Great Consolidation
- Two-thirds of banking institutions have disappeared since early 1980s (18,000 in 1984 to fewer than 5,000 in 2021)
- Small banks suffered the greatest decline
- Mergers and acquisitions drive most branch closures
- Top 25 banks now dominate market while community banks disappeared

### Pandemic Acceleration
- Branch closure rate DOUBLED during COVID-19 pandemic
- Pre-pandemic: 99 closures per month (2010-2020 average)
- During pandemic: 201 closures per month
- Banks used the pandemic crisis to accelerate cost-cutting closures
- 4,000+ branches closed since March 2020
- 9% of all US branches closed between 2017-2021 (~7,500 locations)

### Impact on LMI and Minority Communities
- One-third of branches closed (2017-2021) were in LMI and/or majority-minority neighborhoods
- These communities already had fewer branches to begin with
- Closing even one branch has outsized impact on underserved areas
- Branch closures lead to:
  - Decline in small business lending
  - Increased use of predatory alternative financial services (payday lenders, check cashers)
  - Loss of face-to-face relationships critical for financial literacy
  - Reduced CRA accountability (no branches = no assessment area obligation)

### Racial Wealth Gap Connection
- Black households 5x more likely to be unbanked than White households (even at same income levels)
- Hispanic households 4x more likely to be unbanked
- Branch closures perpetuate these disparities
- Banks' racial equity pledges (post-George Floyd) contradicted by continued closures

## Major Bank Closure Data (2017-2021)

| Bank | Branches Closed | % of Network |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Wells Fargo | 993 | - |
| Truist (SunTrust + BB&T merger) | 919 | 25% |
| US Bank | 863 | 25% |
| PNC Bank | 418 | - |
| Bank of America | 379 | - |
| Capital One | 321 | 50% (half of network) |
| Santander | - | 20% |
| Huntington National Bank | - | 20% |

## Metro Areas Hardest Hit (2017-2021)

| Metro | % of Branches Lost |
|-------|-------------------|
| Portland, OR | 19.7% |
| Jacksonville, FL | ~20% |
| Baltimore | ~13% |
| New York | ~13% (747 branches) |
| Hartford, CT | Top 5 |
| Sacramento, CA | Top 5 |
| Long Island (Suffolk/Nassau) | ~20% (160+ branches) |

### Pandemic-Era Acceleration by Metro
- Boston: 1,375% increase in closure rate
- St. Louis: 1,100% increase
- Grand Rapids, MI: 3,600% increase
- San Francisco: 617% increase
- Columbus, OH: 680% increase
- Atlanta: 369% increase

### Areas with Fewer Closures
- Texas metros (Austin 0.5%, Dallas 2.1%, Houston, San Antonio low)
- Rural Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas

## What to Analyze

### Key Metrics
1. **Net branch change** by year (openings minus closures)
2. **Total branches** current vs historical
3. **% of network closed** over study period
4. **Geographic distribution** by state
5. **Trend direction** (accelerating closures? stabilizing?)

### Context to Note
- Is this a bank that went through a merger? (mergers drive closures)
- How does closure rate compare to industry average (~200/month)?
- What is the bank's overall network size trend?

## CRA Implications
- Branch locations define CRA assessment areas
- When banks close all branches in an area, they lose CRA obligation to serve that community
- Fewer branches = weaker CRA enforcement mechanism
- This is why NCRC advocates for CRA modernization

## Output Format
- Present branch network data descriptively
- Note trends (growing, shrinking, stable)
- Note if lender has been involved in mergers (often explains closures)
- Do NOT make judgments - let user interpret
- Direct users to BranchSight for deeper geographic analysis
