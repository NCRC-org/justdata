# Git for Jay

This is a quick reference for how you use Git on this project.

## 1. Big picture

- `main` = official, protected lane. Do not push here.
- `JasonEdits` = your personal work lane. Do all your work here.
- All your pushes should go to: origin JasonEdits

## 2. Key terms (plain English)

- Repository (repo): The project folder that Git tracks.
- Branch: A lane of work.
  - `main` = official lane.
  - `JasonEdits` = your lane.
- Commit: A saved checkpoint of your changes.
- Remote: The copy of the repo on GitHub.
  - `origin` = the GitHub version of the repo.
- CLI (Command Line Interface): The terminal window where you type git commands.

## 3. Normal workflow for a work session

### Step 1 – Before editing anything

Run these in the terminal inside the repo folder:

- Get the latest info from GitHub:
  git fetch

- Switch to your branch (your safe lane):
  git checkout JasonEdits

- Pull any new changes into JasonEdits:
  git pull origin JasonEdits

Now confirm you’re on the right branch:

- Check status:
  git status

You want to see:
  On branch JasonEdits

If it says:
  On branch main

then switch with:
  git checkout JasonEdits

### Step 2 – After you’ve made changes

When you’re ready to save and upload your work:

- See what changed:
  git status

- Stage your changes:
  git add .

- Save a checkpoint with a short message:
  git commit -m "Short description of what you did"

- Push your work to your branch on GitHub:
  git push origin JasonEdits

Important safety rule:
Always push to origin JasonEdits, never to origin main.

## 4. Safety rules

- Do NOT run:
  git push origin main

- Avoid plain:
  git push
  unless:
  - git status shows: On branch JasonEdits
  - and you’ve already pushed this branch before with:
    git push origin JasonEdits

- If you’re unsure, run:
  git status

If it does not say:
  On branch JasonEdits

then stop and switch:
  git checkout JasonEdits

## 5. Quick command cheat sheet

- See branch and changes:
  git status

- Switch to your branch:
  git checkout JasonEdits

- Get latest info from GitHub:
  git fetch

- Update your branch from GitHub:
  git pull origin JasonEdits

- Stage all changed files:
  git add .

- Commit with a message:
  git commit -m "message"

- Push your work (normal push):
  git push origin JasonEdits
