# Contacts Search Summary

## Search Results

**Total contacts searched:** 108,503  
**Contacts found in Epstein documents:** 2  
**Search method:** Email address matching

## Contacts Found

### 1. McKinnon (john.mckinnon@wsj.com)
- **Record ID:** 2346959
- **Email:** john.mckinnon@wsj.com
- **Found in:** TEXT\001\HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028406.txt

### 2. editors@barrons.com
- **Record ID:** 2337374
- **Email:** editors@barrons.com
- **Found in:** TEXT\001\HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012048.txt
- **Match type:** Email

## Files Created

1. **contacts_found_in_epstein.csv** - CSV with all matches
2. **contacts_found_in_epstein_report.txt** - Detailed report

## Search Methodology

The search used the pre-extracted email list from Epstein documents (664 unique emails) and matched against:
- Primary email addresses from contacts
- Additional email addresses from contacts

## Notes

- **Name-only searches:** The current search only matches by email address. If you want to search for contacts by name only (when email doesn't match), this would require searching all 2,897 text files for each contact name, which would be very time-consuming.
- **Federal Reserve contact:** I noticed Isabel Echarte (isabel.m.echarte@frb.gov) in your contacts list, but this email was not found in the Epstein documents.

## Next Steps

If you want to search for names (not just emails), I can create a script that:
1. Searches for contacts by full name (First Last, Last First)
2. This will take significantly longer (potentially hours)
3. Would search all text files for each contact name

Would you like me to run a name-based search as well?
